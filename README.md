# Statement:

Tic Tac Toe or Three in a Row is a popular game and/or pastime. It is a game with extremely simple rules, which does not pose any major difficulties for its players and is easily learned. Its origins are unknown, with indications that it may have begun in ancient Egypt, where boards carved into the rock were found, which are believed to be over 3,500 years old. In some way, it is a "related" game to "Merels" (see Marel).

Some urban legends say that the game originated in Portugal, in the city of Almada in the year 545. However, it was only popularized in the year 1500, by the discoverer Pedro Álvares Cabral, who loved to play this game during his travels. Álvares Cabral decided that this game would be the first to be taught to the indigenous people in Brazil.
